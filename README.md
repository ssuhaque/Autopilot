Autopilot (Hamdard University 2002)

The goal of this project is to present an integrated treatment of basic elements of aircraft
stability, flight control and autopilot. An understanding of flight stability and control
played an important role in the ultimate success of the earliest aircraft designs. In later
years the design of automatic control ushered in the rapid development of commercial
and military aircraft. Today both military and civilian aircraft rely heavily on automatic
control systems to provide artificial stabilization and autopilot to aid pilots in navigating
and landing their aircraft in adverse weather condition.

This project is small part of real time flight simulator it deals with control surfaces of
airplane and their automatic control. It includes simulation of controllers like pitch, roll
heading altitude and velocity controllers. These controllers are implemented using both
classical control theory (standalone controllers) and modern control theory (in stability
augmentation system). For implementing classical control theory based transfer function
and state vectors for stability augmentation system based on modern control theory
derivatives of stability coefficients are required. User of this software can feed directly
derivatives of stability coefficients or user can also feed raw data so that derivatives of
stability coefficients can derived. And yes for some components of controllers like rate
gyro and vertical gyro transfer function are feed directly. For test purpose we have feed
raw data for STOL and derivatives of stability coefficients for NAVION and F104A
airplane.

This report is divided into four parts first deals with stability (both static and dynamic)
and control surfaces and their contribution in aircraft dynamic. Second part deals with
development of aircraft equations of motion, aerodynamic modeling of aircraft, quality of
flight and motion due to control input. Third part is devoted to aircraft autopilot.
Autopilot is designed both with classical and modern control theory. The fourth part is of
source code and here we have included the code of our project. The code for this project
is written in MATLAB, rightly called the language of technical computing.

This project named as “Simulation of Autopilot” is presented here as our final year
project, when we selected this project we never knew that it would be so difficult be to
work on a project whose field was totally new for us and we had no prior knowledge of
the subject. We had to start work on this project from the basic level, starting with the
basic understanding of aircraft and flight controls and then stability we had to study a lot
of material to build our concepts about the topic from zero level to quite an advance
level. As much as we moved forward and progressed, the subject became more and more
interesting and fascinating. Now when we have finished this project and look at its final
form we feel very much satisfied on what we had achieved and feel proud by the
encouragement and appreciation of our project advisor Mr. Tarique Ahmed, who helped
us throughout the project, he was always kind in explaining the problems and he always
maintained good and cordial relations with us and without his support we might not have
been able to complete this project.
